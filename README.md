### Behold, the power of Abuse

**Abuse** allows you to use profanity when you need it, without the need for getting angry. There's no need to manually search curse words from **Google**, or to ask anybody. Abuse is 100% automatic, thanks to Python.

It's available over Python Package Installer as **[PyPI/abuse](https://pypi.org/project/abuse/)**

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. You should try it!

#### Let's import the beast

```
>>>import abuse as ab
>>>ab.list_from("a")

['...', '...', '...'] # gives a nice list of profane words starting with the letter 'a'
```

# Usage

- `list_from('letter')` : Returns list of abuses starting from a specific letter.
- `random_from('letter')` : Returns a random abuse starting from a specific letter.
- `random()` : Returns any random profane word from it's built-in dataset.
- `list_all()` : Returns list of profane words in it's database.

# Compatibility

_Abuse officially supports Python 3.4 to 3.7, but can also run on Python 2.*_

# Installation

To install Abuse, simply use pipenv _(or pip, of course)_:

```
$ pip install abuse
$ pipenv install abuse
C:\Python34\Scripts> pip install abuse
C:\> py -3 -m pip install abuse
```

**Satisfaction guaranteed.**

# Documentation
Fantastic documentation will be available in some days, for a limited time only.
