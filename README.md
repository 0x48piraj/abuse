**Behold, the power of Abuse v1.** (https://pypi.org/project/abuse/)

**Abuse** allows you to use profanity when you need it, without the need for getting angry. There's no need to manually search curse words from **Google**, or to ask anybody. Abuse is 100% automatic, thanks to Python.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. You should try it!

- Let's import the beast :

```
>>>import abuse as ab
>>>ab.list_abuses_from("a")

['...', '...', '...'] #gives a list of abuses starting with the letter 'a'
```

# Feature Support

> Abuse is in it's beta.

- `list_abuses_from(first_letter)` : Returns list of abuses starting from a specific letter.
- `random_abuse_from(first_letter()` : Returns a random abuse starting from a specific letter.
- `random_abuse()` : Returns any random abuse from it's built-in dataset.
- `list_all_abuses()` : Returns list of abuses in it's database.


_Abuse officially supports Python 3.4 to 3.7, but can also run on Python 2._
